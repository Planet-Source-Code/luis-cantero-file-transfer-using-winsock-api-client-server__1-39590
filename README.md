### Description

This is a small example of how to make a listening server and a client that sends a file to it using Winsock API. How it works?: You need to open the server, then the client, select a folder containing images (BMP, GIF or JPG), for each image, you will need to select a value from the 3 combo boxes (these properties describe each image in some way), then you just enter the server's IP address and click on Send. The server accepts only one connection at a time (it stops listening until the transfer is complete), however, it can be modified to accet multiple connections. It uses a protocol similar to SMTP to get the image and its properties. It then saves the image and stores its info in a DB. Please vote if you like it. Thanks.
